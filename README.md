Ray tracer in Python

I was grinding down in my C++ ray-tracer. I 
can't get the clean syntax there that I want.
I think that Python is probably the best match
for the interface that I want. Therefore, a
lot of this will be stolen from the C++ version.
If you can't plagiarize yourself, who can you
plagiarize?

The idea is to make the nice, super-clean
interface here, then use what I learn to port
to C++ and/or Rust.
